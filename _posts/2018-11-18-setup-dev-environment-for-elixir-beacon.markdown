[Elixir Beacon][elixir-beacon] is a bioinformatics microservice which allows to query a 
genome variant-calling dataset for the absence or presence of a specific variant. Such a 
service is of interest as it can provide anonymized information from sensitive datasets.
Beacon is also part and has been chosen as a driver project of the [*Global Alliance for Genomics and Health*][ga-4-gh].

The project repository is available on the [github][elixir-github]. I use currently IntelliJ as IDE with Spring plugin. In IntelliJ project import is selected. The *pom* there are multiple *pom* files, hence the the option for recursive project file search should be activated.
